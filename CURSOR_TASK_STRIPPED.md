# CURSOR TASK: Strip to Three Pillars

## OBJECTIVE

Remove everything that isn't rock solid. The release should be **six files, three pillars, bulletproof.**

---

## THE THREE PILLARS

```
Pillar 1: THE LAW      → E = ΔI / A (physics)
Pillar 2: THE CONSTANT → μ = 34 ± 2 (two paths converge)
Pillar 3: THE PI TEST  → 2,275 years, 4/4 transitions, zero exceptions
```

Everything else is either supporting material or speculation that dilutes the core.

---

## FINAL STRUCTURE

```

├── README.md        # Three Pillars + navigation
├── SUMMARY.md       # One-page version
├── CORE_LAW.md      # Pillar 1: The Law (deep dive)
├── CONSTANTS.md     # Pillar 2: The Constant (deep dive)
├── PI_TEST.md       # Pillar 3: The Evidence (deep dive)
└── STATUS.md        # What's proven vs. not
```

**Six files. That's it.**

---

## TASK 1: DELETE THESE FILES

Remove from repository:
- [ ] HYPOTHESES.md (speculation dilutes the pillars)
- [ ] EVIDENCE.md (other backtests have selection bias - Pi Test is enough)
- [ ] FORMAL_DEFINITIONS.md (merge essentials into CORE_LAW.md)
- [ ] METHODS_APPENDIX.md (merge essentials into PI_TEST.md)
- [ ] Any other files not in the six-file structure above

---

## TASK 2: UPDATE README.md

Should contain ONLY:
1. Title and tagline
2. The Three Pillars (brief)
3. Pi Test summary table (the killer evidence)
4. Document guide (6 files)
5. What would falsify this
6. Citation and contact

**Remove:**
- "What's Established / What's Observed / What's Speculative" sections (that's in STATUS.md)
- "How to Use This Framework" (unnecessary)
- "Changes from Version 1.0" (unnecessary)

---

## TASK 3: UPDATE SUMMARY.md

One page. Three pillars. Nothing else.

Structure:
1. THE LAW (equation + grounding)
2. THE CONSTANT (μ + two paths)
3. THE PI TEST (table + Bellard)
4. What would falsify
5. Citation

**Remove any speculation or "what builds from pillars" sections.**

---

## TASK 4: UPDATE CORE_LAW.md (Pillar 1)

Should contain:
1. The equation: E = ΔI / A
2. Precise definitions with units
3. Connection to Landauer (thermodynamics)
4. Connection to Bekenstein (information theory)
5. Connection to Least Action (physics)
6. What would falsify

**Remove:**
- Anything about consciousness
- Anything about emergence levels
- Anything speculative

---

## TASK 5: UPDATE CONSTANTS.md (Pillar 2)

Should contain:
1. μ = 34 ± 2 definition
2. Physical derivation (E_planck / E_human)
3. Mathematical derivation (π³ + (21/22)π)
4. The convergence (two paths → same answer)
5. Uncertainty acknowledgment

**Keep but clearly label as "observed pattern, not derived":**
- ℏ = π^(-68) with corrections
- Cosmological ratios

**Remove:**
- Fine structure constant (94% isn't strong enough)
- Mass ratios (interesting but not pillar-level)
- Anything about chronons or consciousness

---

## TASK 6: UPDATE PI_TEST.md (Pillar 3)

This is your crown jewel. Should contain:
1. Why Pi is the perfect test
2. Complete historical data table (Archimedes → 2025)
3. E calculations for key transitions
4. The four transitions with E ratios
5. The Bellard result (efficiency beats resources)
6. Why there's no selection bias

**Remove:**
- "Time bridge" section (interesting but not core)
- "Pi might be the universe computing itself" (speculation)
- Predictions about quantum computers (speculation)

---

## TASK 7: UPDATE STATUS.md

Simple hierarchy:
1. THE THREE PILLARS (rock solid)
2. OBSERVED PATTERNS (ℏ, cosmological - strong but fitted)
3. NOT INCLUDED IN THIS RELEASE (acknowledge speculation exists but isn't here)

**Remove detailed hypothesis descriptions. Just acknowledge they exist and aren't included.**

---

## TASK 8: VERIFY NO PRIVATE CONTENT

Check that NONE of these appear in ANY file:
- [ ] Concentration_Rate = (R × I × S × D) / (V × C × F)
- [ ] Variables R, I, S, D, V, C, F with definitions
- [ ] VOC extraction analysis
- [ ] Standard Oil intelligence network details
- [ ] Mag 7 concentration calculations
- [ ] Intervention design
- [ ] "Predator/prey" framing
- [ ] Phase 1/2/3/4 references
- [ ] Any file from the private framework

---

## TASK 9: FINAL CHECKLIST

Before commit:
- [ ] Only 6 files in repository
- [ ] All files use "ΔI" not "ΔCertainty"
- [ ] μ = 34 ± 2 (with uncertainty)
- [ ] ℏ corrections labeled as "empirically fitted"
- [ ] No "recursive proof" language
- [ ] No speculation about consciousness/chronons/time
- [ ] Pi Test prominently featured
- [ ] Falsification criteria present
- [ ] No private content
- [ ] DOI and contact correct

---

## WHY THIS APPROACH

**Tight = Strong**

Every extra claim is an attack surface. The speculation about consciousness, chronons, time-as-fundamental - all interesting, but:
- Can't be proven
- Can be attacked
- Dilutes the pillars

**The three pillars are bulletproof:**
1. The Law is physics
2. The Constant is arithmetic
3. The Pi Test is 2,275 years of data

Anyone who wants to attack you has to:
- Disprove Landauer (they can't)
- Disprove the arithmetic (they can't)
- Find an exception in 2,275 years of π computation (there isn't one)

**Let the pillars stand alone. They're enough.**

## AFTER CURSOR

1. Run these tasks
2. Verify 6 files only
3. Generate new Zenodo DOI
4. Update GitHub
5. Announce

---

*"Three pillars. Six files. Bulletproof."*
