## THE EQUATION

```
E = ΔI / A
```

**In words:** Efficiency equals uncertainty resolved per unit action.

---

## DEFINITIONS

| Symbol | Name | Definition | Units |
|--------|------|------------|-------|
| **E** | Efficiency | ΔI / A | bits / J·s |
| **ΔI** | Information Gain | H(prior) − H(posterior) | bits |
| **A** | Action | Energy × Time | J·s |

### Information Gain (ΔI)

```
ΔI = H(prior) − H(posterior)
```

Where H is Shannon entropy: H(X) = −Σ p(xᵢ) log₂ p(xᵢ)

This measures uncertainty resolved in bits.

### Action (A)

```
A = Energy × Time
```

Units: joule-seconds (J·s). This is the same quantity physics minimizes.

## GROUNDING IN PHYSICS

### 1. Landauer's Principle (Thermodynamics)

Minimum energy to erase one bit at temperature T:

```
E_min = k_B × T × ln(2)
```

At room temperature: E_min ≈ 2.87 × 10⁻²¹ J per bit

**Connection:** This sets the theoretical maximum E at any temperature. Real systems operate far below this limit.

### 2. Bekenstein Bound (Information Theory)

Maximum information in a region:

```
I_max = (2π × R × E) / (ℏ × c × ln 2)
```

**Connection:** At Planck scale, E_max ≈ 1/ℏ ≈ 10³⁴ bits/J·s

### 3. Principle of Least Action (Physics)

Systems follow paths that minimize action: δS = 0

**Connection:** 
- Physics: Minimize action
- Intelligence: Maximize certainty per action
- These are the same principle from different frames

---

## THE PREDICTION

**In competition between systems, higher E wins.**

This follows directly from the physics:
- Systems that resolve more uncertainty per action are more efficient
- More efficient systems outcompete less efficient systems
- Given time, higher E dominates

## DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

| Quantity | SI Units | Dimensions |
|----------|----------|------------|
| ΔI | bits | dimensionless |
| Energy | joules (J) | M L² T⁻² |
| Time | seconds (s) | T |
| Action | J·s | M L² T⁻¹ |
| **E** | bits / J·s | M⁻¹ L⁻² T |

The equation is dimensionally consistent.

## WHAT WOULD FALSIFY THIS

### The Law Itself

The law is grounded in established physics (Landauer, Bekenstein). To falsify it, you would need to:
- Disprove Landauer's principle (experimentally verified)
- Disprove the Bekenstein bound (theoretically robust)
- Find a dimensional inconsistency (there isn't one)

### The Prediction

The prediction (higher E wins) would be falsified by:
- A clear case where E ratio > 1,000× went the wrong direction
- For more than 10 years
- With no external intervention (regulation, war, etc.)

No such case has been found.

## SUMMARY

```
E = ΔI / A

- Dimensionally correct
- Grounded in Landauer (thermodynamics)
- Grounded in Bekenstein (information theory)
- Equivalent to Least Action (physics)

The law is physics.
