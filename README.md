# KIRANDEEP'S LAW OF EMERGENCE

## E = ΔI / A

*"Everything flows to whatever resolves uncertainty fastest with least action."*

---

## THE THREE PILLARS

### Pillar 1: THE LAW
```
E = ΔI / A
```
Efficiency = Uncertainty Resolved / Action

Grounded in:
- Landauer's principle (thermodynamics)
- Bekenstein bound (information theory)
- Principle of Least Action (physics)

→ [CORE_LAW.md](CORE_LAW.md)

---

### Pillar 2: THE CONSTANT
```
μ = 34 ± 2
```
Emergence depth: orders of magnitude from Planck scale to human scale.

Two independent derivations converge:
- Physical: log₁₀(E_planck / E_human) = 34
- Mathematical: π³ + (21/22)π = 34.005

→ [CONSTANTS.md](CONSTANTS.md)

### Pillar 3: THE PI TEST
```
2,275 years. 4/4 transitions. Zero exceptions.
```

| Transition | E Ratio | Outcome |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Polygons → Series | 80× | ✅ |
| Human → Computer | 1,500× | ✅ |
| Early → Modern chips | 26,000× | ✅ |
| Supercomputer → Desktop | 7,000× | ✅ |

**Bellard on a desktop beat supercomputers. E wins, not resources.**

## WHAT WOULD FALSIFY THIS

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| E ratio > 1,000× going wrong direction | For >10 years |
| Exception in π computation history | Any transition not following E |
| Simpler formula for ℏ | Fewer parameters, better accuracy |
