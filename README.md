## The Law

```
E = ΔCertainty / Action
```

Where:
- **E** = Efficiency (what nature maximizes)
- **ΔCertainty** = Bits of uncertainty resolved
- **Action** = Energy × Time

**Emergence occurs when: E_new / E_old > 1**

## What This Explains

| Phenomenon | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| Platform concentration | E_platform >> E_individual |
| Bits beating atoms | E_bits >> E_atoms |
| Ideas spreading | High-E patterns replicate |
| Evolution | Survival of most efficient |
| Your decisions | Optimize for E, not money |

## The Layers

| Layer | Domain | Key Insight |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Equation | E = ΔCertainty / Action |
| 1 | Thermodynamics | Certainty = -ΔEntropy |
| 2 | Emergence | E_new > E_old triggers new level |
| 3 | Information | Bits > Atoms (higher E) |
| 4 | Economics | Money = stored entropy reduction |
| 5 | Concentration | High E extracts from Low E |
| 6 | Time | Ideas are wormholes through time |
| 7 | Individual | Your E determines your survival |
| 8 | Intuition | E_felt / E_articulated |
| 9 | Recursion | Law proves itself |
| 10 | Physics | ER=EPR (information = spacetime) |

## The Recursive Proof

This law was derived using itself:

1. The path that led here optimized for E
2. The law explains why that path worked
3. Self-reference is the signature of truth

---

## Origin Story

```
High-paying loans → Stopped → To understand money
→ Understanding money → Understanding extraction
→ Understanding extraction → Understanding emergence
→ Understanding emergence → This law
```

The loan business email is the contact because the story of loans is embedded in the discovery.

## The Test

The law predicts its own fate:

```
If E_this_law is high → It spreads
If E_this_law is low → It doesn't
Either outcome is information
Either outcome confirms or refines the law
```

**Release is the experiment.**
