# KIRANDEEP'S LAW OF EMERGENCE

## E = ΔI / A

*"Everything flows to whatever resolves uncertainty fastest with least action."*

---

## Quick Start

**The Law:**
```
E = ΔI / A

E = Efficiency (bits per joule-second)
ΔI = Uncertainty resolved (bits)
A = Action = Energy × Time (joule-seconds)
```

**The Prediction:** In competition, higher E wins.

**The Evidence:** 11/11 tests passed (5 historical, 4 pi computation, 2 cosmological)

## What's Established

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| E = ΔI / A is dimensionally correct | ✅ Proven |
| Higher E wins in competition | ✅ Supported (11/11 tests) |
| μ = 34 ± 2 (emergence depth) | ✅ Derived |

## What's Observed (Patterns, Not Derivations)

| Claim | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| ℏ ≈ π^(−68) | 99.997% |
| α ≈ π^(−μ/8) | 94% |
| DM/NM = π^(3/2) | 98% |
| DE/TM = e^(3/4) | 98% |

## What's Speculative

| Hypothesis | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Time is fundamental | Plausible but untested |
| 1 bit = 1 chronon | Interesting but undefined |
| Consciousness threshold | Untestable as stated |

---

## Changes from Version 1.0

| Change | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Added uncertainty to μ (±2) | Honesty about E_human estimate |
| Labeled ℏ corrections as empirical | They were fitted, not derived |
| Created separate HYPOTHESES.md | Clear distinction from proven claims |
| Added falsification criteria | Scientific rigor |
| Removed "recursive proof" language | Logical error |

## How to Use This Framework

### To Test It
1. Pick a competition (past or ongoing)
2. Calculate E for both sides using methods in EVIDENCE.md
3. Record prediction before checking outcome
4. Compare

### To Extend It
1. Ground extensions in the core law (E = ΔI / A)
2. Be explicit about what's derived vs. speculated
3. Propose falsifiable predictions
4. Acknowledge limitations

### To Critique It
1. Find cases where higher E lost
2. Propose simpler formulas for constants
3. Replicate the backtests independently
4. Challenge the methodology

## What Would Falsify This

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| E ratio > 1,000× going wrong direction | |
| Duration > 10 years | |
| No external intervention | |

One clear case meeting all criteria would seriously challenge the theory.
