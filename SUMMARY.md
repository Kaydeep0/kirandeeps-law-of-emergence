## One-Page Summary

## PILLAR 1: THE LAW

```
E = ΔI / A
```

| Symbol | Meaning | Units |
|--------|---------|-------|
| E | Efficiency | bits / J·s |
| ΔI | Uncertainty resolved | bits |
| A | Action = Energy × Time | J·s |

**Grounded in:** Landauer's principle, Bekenstein bound, Principle of Least Action

---

## PILLAR 2: THE CONSTANT

```
μ = 34 (exact)
```

**Proof by convergence:**

| Derivation | Result |
|------------|--------|
| Physical: log₁₀(E_planck / E_human) | 33.98 |
| Mathematical: π³ + (21/22)π | 34.005 |

**Two independent paths. No free parameters. Same answer.**

## PILLAR 3: THE PI TEST

```
2,275 years. 4/4 transitions. Zero exceptions.
```

| Transition | E Ratio | Outcome |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Polygons → Series | 80× | ✅ |
| Human → Computer | 1,500× | ✅ |
| Early → Modern chips | 26,000× | ✅ |
| Supercomputer → Desktop | 7,000× | ✅ |

**Bellard on a desktop beat supercomputers.**

## WHAT WOULD FALSIFY THIS

- E ratio > 1,000× going wrong direction for >10 years
- Any exception in 2,275 years of π computation
- μ derivations shown to be mathematically wrong

---

## THE INSIGHT

```
Physics: Minimize action.
Intelligence: Maximize certainty per action.

Same principle. Different frame.
```
