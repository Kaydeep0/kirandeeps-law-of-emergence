# QUICK REFERENCE

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Core Law | 3 claims | ✅ All established |
| Constant μ | 2 claims | ✅ Derived with uncertainty |
| Physics Derivations | 5 claims | ⚠️ Observed patterns (90-99%) |
| Cosmological | 4 claims | ⚠️ Post-hoc formulas (97-99%) |
| Hypotheses | 6 claims | ❓ Untested speculation |

# TIER 1: ESTABLISHED

These claims are on solid ground.

## 1.1 The Core Law

| Claim | Evidence | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| E = ΔI / A is dimensionally correct | Dimensional analysis | ✅ |
| Connects to Landauer & Bekenstein | Physics literature | ✅ |
| Higher E wins in competition | 11/11 tests passed | ✅ |

## 1.2 The Evidence Base

| Evidence | Tests | Passed | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| Historical backtests | 5 | 5 | ✅ |
| Pi computation history | 4 | 4 | ✅ |
| Cosmological ratios | 2 | 2 | ✅ |

**Caveat:** Selection bias acknowledged in backtests.

# TIER 2: DERIVED WITH UNCERTAINTY

These claims are derived but have known limitations.

## 2.1 The Constant μ

| Claim | Method | Result | Uncertainty |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| μ = log₁₀(E_planck/E_human) | Ratio of scales | 34 | ±2 |
| μ = π³ + (21/22)π | Observed pattern | 34.005 | N/A |

**Issue:** E_human estimate varies from 10⁻² to 10¹ bits/J·s depending on how you measure a human.

**Status:** ⚠️ Derived but uncertainty acknowledged.

## 2.2 Two Independent Paths Converge

```
Physical path: μ = log₁₀(10³⁴ / 10⁰) = 34
Mathematical path: μ = π(π² + 21/22) = 34.005
```

This convergence is interesting but unexplained.

# TIER 3: OBSERVED PATTERNS

These formulas work but were found by fitting, not derivation.

## 3.1 Planck's Constant

| Formula | Predicted | Actual | Accuracy |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| ℏ ≈ π^(−2μ) | 1.58×10⁻³⁴ | 1.055×10⁻³⁴ | 50% |
| ℏ = π^(−68.34)* | 1.0546×10⁻³⁴ | 1.0546×10⁻³⁴ | 99.997% |

*With empirically fitted corrections (1/3, 54, 55, 6072)

**Status:** ⚠️ The full formula works, but correction terms are unexplained.

## 3.2 Other Physical Constants

| Constant | Formula | Accuracy | Status |
|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| Fine structure α | π^(−μ/8) | 94% | ⚠️ Approximate |
| mₚ/mₑ | π^(4μ/3) | 99% | ⚠️ Observed |
| m_proton/mₑ | π^(6.6) | 96% | ⚠️ Observed |

## 3.3 Cosmological Quantities

| Quantity | Formula | Accuracy | Status |
|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| DM/NM | π^(3/2) | 98% | ⚠️ Post-hoc |
| DE/TM | e^(3/4) | 98% | ⚠️ Post-hoc |
| Dimensions | floor(π) | Exact | ⚠️ Post-hoc |
| Generations | ≈π | Exact | ⚠️ Post-hoc |

**Status:** These formulas match observations but the "why" is speculation.

# TIER 4: HYPOTHESES

These are clearly speculative and require substantial development.

| # | Hypothesis | Status | Testability |
|---|------------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Time is fundamental | Plausible | Hard |
| 2 | 1 bit = 1 chronon | Interesting | Needs operationalization |
| 3 | Consciousness at μ ≈ 30 | Untestable as stated | Needs definition |
| 4 | Consciousness = time knowing itself | Philosophical | Not scientific |
| 5 | π = structure, e = dynamics | Suggestive | Needs more data |
| 6 | Emergence levels = π² steps | Speculative | Needs measurement |

**These are NOT claims. They are questions for future work.**

# FALSIFICATION CRITERIA

## What Would Falsify the Core Law

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| E ratio | > 1,000× |
| Direction | Lower E wins |
| Duration | > 10 years |
| External factors | No major intervention |

One clear case meeting all criteria would falsify the core prediction.

## What Would Falsify the Derivations

| Claim | Falsified If |
|-------|--------------|
| μ = 34 | Better measurement gives μ outside 30-38 |
| ℏ = π^(−68) | Simpler formula with fewer parameters matches better |
| DM/NM = π^(3/2) | Observations revised outside 4-7 |

## What Would NOT Count as Falsification

- Individual edge cases with E ratio near 1
- Measurement uncertainty in E calculations
- Long timescales when friction is high
- Philosophical disagreements about definitions

# OPEN QUESTIONS

## Questions About the Core Law

1. What exactly determines the timescale to dominance?
2. How do we handle cases with strong friction (QWERTY, etc.)?
3. Is there a minimum E ratio needed to predict confidently?

## Questions About μ

1. Why is μ = π³ + (21/22)π? Is this fundamental?
2. Where do the correction terms (1/3, 54, 55, 6072) come from?
3. Can μ be derived from first principles?

## Questions About the Hypotheses

1. Can the chronon be operationally defined?
2. Is there a test that distinguishes "time fundamental" from "spacetime unified"?
3. What would a consciousness experiment look like?

# WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE VERSION 1.0

| Change | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| Added uncertainty to μ (±2) | E_human estimate varies |
| Labeled correction terms as empirical | Intellectual honesty |
| Separated hypotheses from derivations | Clarity |
| Added falsification criteria | Scientific rigor |
| Removed "recursive proof" language | Logic error |
| Added prospective predictions | Testability |

# RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USERS

## If You Want to Test the Theory

1. Calculate E for a competition BEFORE the outcome
2. Document your methodology
3. Record predictions publicly
4. Report outcomes (including failures)

## If You Want to Extend the Theory

1. Start with the core law (E = ΔI / A)
2. Be clear about what's derived vs. hypothesized
3. Propose falsifiable predictions
4. Acknowledge limitations

## If You're Skeptical

Good. The framework benefits from scrutiny.

1. Find cases where higher E lost
2. Propose simpler formulas for constants
3. Test the backtests independently
4. Challenge the methodology

  11/11 tests passed (the evidence)

DERIVED:
  μ = 34 ± 2 (with acknowledged uncertainty)
  ℏ, α, mass ratios (observed patterns, not derivations)

HYPOTHESIZED:
  Time fundamental
  Bit = chronon
  Consciousness threshold
  (These are questions, not claims)
