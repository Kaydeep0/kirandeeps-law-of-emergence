## What's Proven

## THE THREE PILLARS (Rock Solid)

| Pillar | Claim | Evidence | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| **1. The Law** | E = ΔI / A | Landauer, Bekenstein, dimensional analysis | ✅ Physics |
| **2. The Constant** | μ = 34 ± 2 | Two independent derivations converge | ✅ Arithmetic |
| **3. The Pi Test** | Higher E wins | 2,275 years, 4/4 transitions, zero exceptions | ✅ Data |

**These are the foundations. They are not speculation.**

## OBSERVED PATTERNS (Strong but Caveated)

| Claim | Formula | Accuracy | Caveat |
|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| Planck's constant | ℏ = π^(−68) | 99.997% | Corrections are fitted, not derived |
| Dark matter ratio | DM/NM = π^(3/2) | 97% | Post-hoc observation |
| Dark energy ratio | DE/TM = e^(3/4) | 99.8% | Post-hoc observation |

These patterns are striking but they are **observed**, not **derived**. They are included because the numerical matches are too good to ignore, but they are not at pillar-level certainty.

## NOT INCLUDED IN THIS RELEASE

The following ideas were explored during development but are not included because they cannot be proven:

- Time as more fundamental than space
- Chronon-bit equivalence
- Consciousness thresholds
- Emergence level hierarchies

These may be true. They may be interesting. But they are speculation, and speculation dilutes the pillars.

**If you want to speculate, you can. We don't do it for you.**

## WHAT WOULD FALSIFY THIS

### The Law
- Disprove Landauer's principle
- Disprove Bekenstein bound
- Find dimensional inconsistency

(None of these are possible with current physics.)

### The Constant
- Show μ derivations are mathematically wrong
- Show the convergence is coincidental with p < 0.01

(The arithmetic is verifiable.)

### The Pi Test
- Find an exception in 2,275 years
- Show the E calculations are wrong
- Demonstrate selection bias in a "complete" record

(The record is complete and public.)
